						<h3 class="services-sub">Background Checks For Individuals </h3>

						<p class="service-description">
							To be sure of the integrity of an employee, an organization may ask you to complete a criminal record check, or ask you to submit a form to get more information from you. You can get this check done quickly (usually within 24 hrs), and this information can be easily sent to the organization in question in one easy step. You also have the option of receiving the information for yourself, or sending it to multiple organizations at once. We also guarantee a timely turnaround time with consistent, professional results with varification from local police organizations.
						</p>

						<h3 class="services-sub">Profiling for Organizations</h3>

						<p class="service-description">
							Profiling is a more specific strategy where information is usually needed in addition to standard surveillance and investigation practices from background checks. Every case is different, therefore after initial research; each situation is reviewed to determine the best strategy to gain the best results according to the client. Searches during investigations may include researching public databases, court records, as well as other resources such as personal and telephone interviews to try and gain as much relevant information as possible.
						</p>

						<h3 class="services-sub">Missing Persons</h3>
						<p class="service-description">
							Enlisting in the services of a private investigator ensures that the sensitivity and timeliness of the situation will be thoroughly and carefully handled in a confidential manner. All the available information provided by the client will ensure that the investigators have the right tools and knowledge in what method to use in each situation. Cases may be as simple as a postal code look up but in many cases this information may be out of date which an investigator will first use information such as internet searches, public libraries, Personal Property Security Registration (PPSR) searches  or finally cover surveillance to stay as non-intrusive as possible.
